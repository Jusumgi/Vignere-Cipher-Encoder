This is an ongoing project for my CISCO class, in a "friendly-competition" with the Digital Media Arts (DMA) class. They sent us an encoded telegram declaring war, so to show our superiority we will dedicate
server resources to host the provided HTML with an encoded message using the provided JS encoder. We will then inflitrate their classroom on the 12th of February, 2024, where we will give them the link and
they will be forced to decode it and respond.
